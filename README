        \x1b#ff9999mREADME
 
This document is designed to help you learn about the features of the
client, and to help get you started playing the game. We will first
start with a short section on playing the game.
 
        \x1b#ff9999mResources
 
One of the best resouces is www.bat.org. After that you have the in
game help system and newbie channel. The in game help system should
be the first place you look for answers, then the newbie channel.
 
To try the in game help system try typing `help help` in the command
box. Before you type it switch to the `All` tab because the output 
will be listen in that. You should see a listing of help topics. You can 
do `help [topic]` to read a specific topic.
 
The second way is by typing `newbie hello`. To talk to this channel
prefix your message with `newbie`.
 
        \x1b#ff9999mThe Features Of The Client
 
You have:
      * world map that is built as you explore the land.
      * health, spirit, endurance, entity health bar
      * monster health bar
      * spell/skill bar
      * mapper command
 
        \x1b#ff9999mMapper Commands
 
Some dungeons do not have a map. You have to rely on your memory or a pen and
pad to navigate them with out getting lost and maybe stuck. The mapper plugin
which provides the world map also features two command to help you navigate 
these certain dungeons or zones.
 
    mapper findout
        This command when typed and entered will show you the path to any
        known entrance or exit. If you type each navigation key you should
        reach the entrance or exit (or both).
    mapper findnew
        This command when typed and entered will show you the path to any
        room not explored in your current dungeon or zone.
 
The mapper command may not work well inside mazes, and have not yet
been tested. Also, if you login to a dungeon you may need to move one
direction before using the commands or it will complain that you are
not in a dungeon or zone.
 
The dungeon maps are saved as created and loaded on startup. You may
experience a problem if you are teleported into a dungeon and you have
never be through the exit or entrance because it will not know where it
is. In this case the `findout` command will return no results.
